*** Validation ***
  theare two parts of validation: user input validation on PL (Presentation layer) and business rules on Service Layer (BLL).
  there are several ways to implement validation process:
  - [Decoupling the Service Layer]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/models-data/validating-with-a-service-layer-cs#decoupling-the-service-layer and because model state is a part of runtime its necessary to
      - create controller without passing service to it
      - create service and pass controller's model state (as wrapper implemented IValidationDictionary) to it
      - inject service into product controller via DI mechanism
    BUT this method mixed two logic concerns: validation logic with the service logic
  - [Throwing custom exceptions]: BLL will throw an exception if service logic is violated.
    Exceptions are for exceptional cases only, and violating of business rules is exceptional case.

*** Posting data ***
    after POST (Edit action) it is possible to return to same page in two ways
    - return View(viewModel); - sends data from ModelState to View
      it brings to situation when checkboxes are stayed selected even if they are false in viewModel;
      it brings to situation when user refreshes page and send same Post request.
    - return RedirectToAction(nameof(Edit), formId)
      classical Post-Request-Get approach.
